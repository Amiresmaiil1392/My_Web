The Web, also called the World Wide Web, is a big collection of websites that you can visit using the Internet. Think of it like a huge digital library where every website is a different book. You can open any website by typing its address in your browser, like “google.com”.

When you open a website, your device sends a request to a server. A server is like a powerful computer that stores the website’s files. The server sends back the information, and your browser shows it to you as text, images, videos, and buttons.

The Web uses something called HTTP or HTTPS to move information between your device and the server. You can click links to move from one page to another—this is how the Web connects everything together.

In simple words:
The Web = websites + browsers + servers + links.
